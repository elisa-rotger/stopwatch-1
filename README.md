# Stopwatch iOS - vanilla JS

## Project

The main objective is to build a stopwatch as similar to the one in iOS systems as possible using vanilla Javascript and CSS / HTML.

#

## Functionality

The stopwatch should have the following features:
- Start the timer, count in minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
- Pausing the timer.
- Resetting the timer to zero.
- Recording laps while the timer is running.
- The longest lap should be painted red, the shortest, green.
- (Optional) When timer gets to hour counts, the clock should add them to the display.
